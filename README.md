### NJIT-1st-MiniProject
### Project Members: Michelle Boykins and Mykola Lupak
#### Objective:
In this project, students were required to work in groups in 2 or 3. A single repository was to be developed between each group. One person was elected to merge  pull requests as the team leader. It is required to have at least 10 substantive commits per group member that are marked "feature". Any fixes to "features" must be marked as fixes and do not count.  Commits for creating files or renaming files or other non-feature work should be named "task".  

Each project* must include an explanation of how the usage of Git, Docker, automated testing, and continuous integration can improve the productivity and competitiveness of a company. It must also include a section that explains commands and gives example(s) usage for Vi to create and edit files on linux and the basic commands that you need to manage the file system. The gitFlow workflow must also be explained and a section to define and give examples of how to use the Git commands and terminology in the list provided (see link to Vi and Basic Commands to Manage a File System below. 

Each required section can be found by clicking on the Index links below.</br> (*For a project group of two members)
