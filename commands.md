You must have a section that explains commands and gives example(s) usage for use Vi to create and edit files on Linux and the basic commands that you need to manage the file system: Questions to answer: What is it? Why do you do it? How do you do it?

Command | Example
------------ | -------------
**cd**: change directory, to change this current working directory | cd image.md
**mkdir** "make new directory" command, create a new folder: | mkdir new-folder
**cp**: the "cp" command uses the same syntax as the "mv" command. The difference being that while "mv" moves the original file, "cp" creates a second file with the same contents | cp
**pwd**: print working directory, It will return the path to a local folder on your computer's disk | pwd
**mv**: moving a file | mv path/to/file.ext different/path/file.ext
**rm**: delete the file from project and stage the removal for commitment | rm image.md
**history**: checking git commit history | git log, gitk, git show head
**Home directory and ~ function**: ~ is home directory | check git config, home directory in windows: C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Git\config
**file paths in linux**: find the location of GIT installation directory in linux | cd /home/YOURNAME/
**Using the tab key to complete file paths**: It autocompletes what you've written, which reduces typos very efficiently. For example, when you want to switch to a different directory, you can either type every component of the path yourself | cd ~/projects/acmedesign/documentation/
**Using up and down arrow for history**: ARROW UP key, you can step through the last commands you called (starting with the most recently used). ARROW DOWN will move forward in history towards the most recent call | Arrow Keys
